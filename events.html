  <h3> Industry Networking Event - 26 October </h3>
  <p>We usually invite female speakers from different companies within SET industries to talk to  Imperial College students about their careers, their journeys to date, and any specific experiences   they may have encountered as women within male-dominated environments. We provide an  informal, friendly setting in which students can chat to the speakers over food and drinks. Sponsors  are invited to join us for this evening event and provide a speaker to give a talk if they wish to. </p>

  <h5> Future events: </h5>
  <h3> TEDx Event </h3>
  <p> For next academic year, we are set on organising a public speaking to which to invite our sponsors  and create a sharing environment. In 2015, we also held a TEDx Event which featured a speaker   panel made up of prominent figures in different areas, who shared their ideas on how to tackle  gender inequality in the workforce and their own career paths. With early planning we believe we  can make the event impactful and wide-reaching to inspire the student body from Imperial College.
