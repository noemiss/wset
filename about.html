    <h5> Who are we? </h5>
    <p> Women in Science, Engineering and Technology (WSET) is a society at Imperial College London that was founded in 2007 by three female PhD students. The creation of the society was the culmination of a three-year project, founded by the UK Resource Centre (UKRC) for Women in SET from 2004 to 2007, to encourage more female students to pursue careers within SET industries after graduating. 
    The project was managed by Alicia Ahern a lecturer in Civil Engineering at Imperial College London and member of the EnVision team. </p> <hr \>

    <div class="container sub-about">
    <h5> What are our society goals? </h5>
    <p> Our aims as a society is to encourage female science and engineering graduates to pursue careers in SET, but also to encourage young girls to consider pursuing SET degrees at university. Through the events we organise, we aim to challenge the perception students have of scientists and engineers, raise the profile of SET careers for women, and provide female students with visible role models they can aspire to. </p><hr \>

  <div class="container sub-about">
    <h5> Past achievements and collaborations within the university </h5>
    <p> In the past year our society had a significant growth in members and we believe this was a great start that brought us constant high numbers of attendees at all of our events. In previous years, WSET Society has received accolades from key figures both external and internal to Imperial College. The Arts and Cultural advisor to the Mayor has recognised our achievements and praised our efforts towards raising awareness about International Women`s Day and the President of Imperial College awarded us the prestigious ‘Society of the Year’ award in 2009 – 2010 (out of 300 other clubs and societies). </p>
    <p>In the past we have collaborated with the Academic Faculty Ambassadors for Women from the faculties of Natural Sciences, Engineering, Medicine, and Physical Sciences, the College HR Equalities Unit, and the Student Union) and EnVision (the Teaching and Learning Development and Support group for the Faculty of Engineering at Imperial). Moreover, as a confirmation of the fact that our opinions are respected within the College and this society is a vital one for Imperial College, our President was invited to sit on the board of a committee created to address the problem of sexism within Imperial.</p>
